# EMERALD_CROWLEY_3106809_ASSIGNMENT3


This program will multiply two matrices together using the stripe method of matrix multiplication. 
You will have three matrices A,B and C that represent the operation A x B = C. 
You will be required to determine how many nodes are in your compute group and create even stripes for A to be divided amongst the nodes. 
All nodes will receive a copy of B. 
Each node will do a matrix multiplication of its stripe of A with the matrix B to generate its stripe of C. 
Finally all nodes will use the gather operation to send back the stripes to the coordinator node wherein it will be reassembled into a single matrix.


PLEASE NOTE: This program works with some key assumptions
Assumption 1: All matricies put into this program are Square (N x N)
Assumption 2: N is evenly divisible by all nodes
